2. Test Various Scenarios and file bugs for things that dont work

Contributing

3. Commit your changes (git commit -am "Added a sweet feature")
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my_feature_branch)

Development
=============
Clone this repository and use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) to get the dependencies:

```
$ bundle install
```

Once you have the dependencies, you can run the tests with `rake`:

```
$ bundle exec rake spec
```

If those pass, you're ready to start developing the plugin. You can test
the plugin without installing it into your Vagrant environment by just
creating a [Vagrantfile](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/packaging.html)
in the top level of this directory (it is gitignored) that uses it, and
use bundler to execute Vagrant:

```
$ bundle exec vagrant up
```
